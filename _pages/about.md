Greetings!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Brown University. My research interests include ethnic conflict, the political economy of development, and vigilante politics, with a regional focus on South Asia. 

I have substantial training in quantitative research methods, including machine learning, experiments, and surveys. I hold a Sc.M. in Data Science and an A.M. in political science from Brown, as well as an A.B. with Honors in Politics from Princeton. At Brown, I have held academic fellowships through the Graduate Program in Development (GPD) and the Open Graduate Education (OGE) Program. Prior to Brown, I was a Clinton Fellow with the American India Foundation. 

I will be on the job market in the 2024-2025 academic year.
