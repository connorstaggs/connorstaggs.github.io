Greetings!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Brown University. My research interests include ethnic conflict, the political economy of development, and vigilante politics, with a regional focus on South Asia. I will be on the job market in the 2024-2025 academic year. 

I have substantial expertise with quantitative research methods, including machine learning, experiments, and surveys. I earned a Sc.M. in Data Science from Brown as part of the Open Graduate Education Program, an A.M. in political science (also from Brown), and an A.B. with Honors in Politics from Princeton.
